Their lives and traditions have long been dictated by the harsh conditions of the steppe. Serious resource constraints (before the arrival of the Russians, the Buryats were not engaged in the collection and tillage) dictated their own rules of management. Buryat national cuisine is very tasty and varied. The basis of many dishes consumed fresh meat.

    <string name="attract_0_name">Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius</string>
    <!--          attract 1             -->
    <string name="attract_1_name">Assumption Cathedral</string>
    <string name="attract_1_description">The largest and most notable building of the Lavra stands in the center of the monastery. The cathedral was built in 1559-1585, and the Assumption Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin, which by that time was about a hundred years old, was taken as a model. The result is a huge five-domed temple, with the central dome being gilded, and the other four made in blue with stars. There is almost no decor. Inside, the iconostasis has been preserved, some of the icons in which were made in the 16th century (local row), and almost all the rest - at the end of the 17th century. It is known that, among others, Simon Ushakov worked on the iconostasis, but it is not known whether there is anything of his work there. It is possible that he made all six images on the Royal Doors. The entire cathedral, including the domes, is painted with frescoes. They were made in 1684 in three months by Yaroslavl craftsmen under the direction of Dmitry Plekhanov. Saints Innokenty of Moscow (the first bishop of Kamchatka and Alaska) and Macarius Nevsky are buried in the cathedral. Outside, at the western corner of the cathedral, stands the Dormition storehouse with a chapel (originally 1644, but at the end of the 17th century rebuilt under the Baroque, so it turned out to be a wonderful example of the style). The chapel has the form of a miniature church, with carvings and paintings. On the other hand, also outside, the tomb of the Godunovs is located, where, in particular, Tsar Boris Godunov is buried.</string>

    <string name="attract_2_name">Trinity Cathedral</string>
    <string name="attract_2_description">The main temple of the Lavra and its oldest building. The cathedral was built in 1422-23 on the site of a wooden church that stood earlier on this site. It is a four-pillar one-domed temple built of white stone. From the early architecture of the Moscow principality, quite a few buildings have come down to us - in particular, the Trinity Cathedral is noticeably older than the cathedrals of the Moscow Kremlin and a little younger than the churches in Zvenigorod and in the Andronikov monastery in Moscow - and this is certainly one of the best examples of the style. The cathedral is not very large, its height is only 30 m, but the proportions are chosen so well that you dont pay attention to the size. Initially, the cathedral was painted by Andrei Rublev and Daniil Cherny, but their frescoes have not survived, but in the 17th century new ones were painted for the same motives. The iconostasis was created at the beginning of the 15th century (the deesis, festive and prophetic ranks were performed in the workshop of Andrei Rublev) and then supplemented with new icons until the end of the 17th century: in particular, several icons were made by Simon Ushakov. The cathedral houses the tomb of St. Sergius of Radonezh.</string>

    <string name="attract_5_name">Church of the Nativity of John the Baptist</string>
    <string name="attract_5_description">The church was built in the years 1693-1699. It seems that it is rather strangely located, inside the monastery, but very close to the Assumption Gate. Moreover, there is an arch under it, that is, the church was once a gateway. Indeed, once the wall ran to the west than it is now, and later was moved, so that the territory of the lavra increased. The Church of John the Baptist was built on the money of Grigory Stroganov, and it is often ranked among the six surviving Stroganov churches in Russia - the other five are in Solvychegodsk, Ustyuzhna, Usolye and Nizhny Novgorod (two). Like other Stroganov churches, this one has an exceptionally rich exterior decor. The building itself is a quadruple set on a cube, on which, in turn, there are five small domes (they were restored after the 1974 restoration). The iconostasis inside the early 19th century.</string>

    <string name="attract_3_description">The small church between the Assumption and Trinity Cathedrals is the second oldest surviving building of the Lavra. It was built in 1476-1477 by Pskov craftsmen. Pskov architecture is remarkable for its belfries, integrated with the main volumes of churches. Here the builders took as a model the nearby Trinity Cathedral, but added a belfry with bells right above the main volume of the church, and above the belfry they put a single dome (currently blue with stars). This is the oldest structure of this type that has come down to us (the church "like the bells"). The church is brick-built with rich decor. Inside the painting is from 1665, but the iconostasis is relatively new, from the 19th century. Several saints are buried in the church, the most famous of which is Maxim the Greek, the greatest philosopher and theologian of the 16th century.</string>

    <string name="attract_4_description">The tent-roofed church, built in 1635-1637, when the monastery was being rebuilt from the destruction of the Time of Troubles. Kelare Alexander, who coordinated the restoration, was himself from the Solovetsky Monastery (founded by Zosima and Savvaty), from which, probably, the dedication of the church comes. This is the only tent-roofed church in the Lavra: it is assumed that the Transfiguration Cathedral of the Solovetsky Monastery was taken as a model. It is decorated with decor, and at that time it was not entirely trivial. From the south and north, simultaneously with the church, two-story Hospital chambers were built, where elderly monks lived. Inside there is an icon of the 17th century depicting Zosima and Savvaty, the iconostasis itself is modern.</string>

    <string name="attract_6_description">The church, connected to the refectory, is one of the largest in the Lavra and is remarkable for its exterior painting that gives the impression of relief, porches with stairs, as well as rich decor, including columns and shells. Sergievskaya church was built in 1686-1692 and is one of the best examples of Naryshkin baroque. It suffered from a fire in 1746, and in 1749, according to the project of the architect Zhukov, an iron roof was made for it, a rather complex engineering structure at that time. Inside, there is also rich decoration of the late 17th century, murals in 1788 by a group of artists under the direction of a certain Yankovsky. The iconostasis of the 17th century (already brought to our time from Moscow), probably with icons by Semyon Spiridonov. The Refectory Chamber adjacent to the church is the largest historical single-domed building in Russia. Next to the refectory there is a small Mikheevskaya church (1734) with an iconostasis from the 18th century.</string>

    <string name="attract_7_description">A very small church from 1746-1753. was built in order to store the carved stone icon of the Smolensk Mother of God. The icon is now in the museum, and a copy is carved on the outer wall of the church, however, the quality is much inferior to the original. The architect of the church is Dmitry Ukhtomsky, one of the most famous Moscow architects of the 18th century. Apparently, this is why the church has a round layout, which is completely uncharacteristic of Russian churches. Inside a 19th century fresco.</string>

The height of the bell tower is 88 m, which is higher than the bell tower of Ivan the Great in the Moscow Kremlin, and has four tiers, standing on a cubic base. Several bells are historical (the oldest was cast in 1420), the rest were melted down in the 1930s, and new bells were cast already in the 2000s.</string>

The polychrome "checkerboard" coloring of its facade echoes the design of the Refectory Church opposite. On the western side of the building, the stucco decoration of 1745-1748 has been preserved, where, among other things, there are images of the battles of Peter I. The interior decoration includes two tiled stoves from the middle of the 17th century, not the most outstanding painting of the vaults was made in the middle of the 18th century. The room is occupied by a church-archaeological study with a collection of books, icons and church utensils.</string>

So, for example, three kilometers southeast of the Lavra is the Gethsemane Chernigov skete, which at one time was not inferior to the Lavra in terms of the number of pilgrims. It was founded in 1845-1850, most of the buildings have survived to this day. The architectural dominant is a five-tiered bell tower with two aisles (1895), towering over the district. Cave temples, a chapel, monastic cells and a holy underground spring under the Chernigov Cathedral (1886-1893) attract tourists and pilgrims to this day. Excursions are organized around the skete. The monastic hostel was reopened in 1990.</string>

It was built of red bricks and integrated into the brick building of the dacha, which has also been preserved. For a long time, the building was used inappropriately, in particular, it housed a bearing plant, called the "Laboratory of an experimental plant" - an abbreviation for this name and gave the name to the village. Now, there is a boarding school for girls-orphans and a convent inside, but outside the building of the dacha and the church are more interesting than inside.</string>

In Soviet times, the garden turned into a park of culture and recreation for workers, and only in the early 2000s, work began here to restore its former glory. Thanks to them, today in Pafnutievsky Garden you can leisurely stroll along the paved paths, relax on comfortable benches under the lanterns, admire the manicured lawns and flower beds and enjoy the coolness of the pond. And for the historical landmark in the garden, there is a brick gazebo on the wall tower, from where the Lavra archimandrites once listened to the silence of the garden.</string>
